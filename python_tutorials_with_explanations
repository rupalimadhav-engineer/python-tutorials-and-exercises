"""here i am creating custom code snippet so whenever i create a python file python automatically insert %##
its we are doing because i want to run code seperetly not whole script every time
there are some shortcuts in  pycharm but it gives whole output of script
Go to File → Settings → Editor → File and Code Templates
Select Python Script
Add this at the top of the template:
#%%
Click Apply → OK
✔ Now every new Python file you create will automatically start with a #%% cell."""
