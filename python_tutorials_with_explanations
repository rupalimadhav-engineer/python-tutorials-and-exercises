#2.ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS:
'''
Python 3.8 introduced the := operator, known as the "walrus operator". It assigns values to variables as part of 
a larger expression:
# 📝 **Short Notes: Walrus Operator (:=) vs Assignment (=) — Interview Answer**
### **1. What is the Walrus Operator?**
The **walrus operator (`:=`)** in Python 3.8+ allows **assignment inside expressions**.
It lets you assign a value *and* use it immediately within the same line.
---
# 🆚 **Difference Between `:=` and `=`**

| Feature              | `=` (Assignment Operator)    | `:=` (Walrus Operator)                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose              | Assigns value to variable    | Assigns value **within** an expression        |
| Where it can be used | Only as a separate statement | Inside conditions, loops, list comprehensions |
| Expression allowed?  | ❌ No                         | ✔️ Yes                                        |
| Introduced in        | Old versions                 | Python 3.8+ 
                                  
# 🧠 **Simple Explanation**
* `=` assigns a value normally:
  x = 5

* `:=` assigns a value while evaluating a condition or expression:
'''

#%%
if (x := 5) > 3:
  print(x)

'''# 🟢 **Example 1: IF Condition**

### Without Walrus:
n = len(items)
if n > 3:
  print(n)
    
### With Walrus:
if (n := len(items)) > 3:
    print(n)
'''
''''**Benefit:** `len(items)` is called once and code becomes shorter.
**Benefit:** Cleaner loop, no repeated input call.
**Benefit:** Cleaner, more Pythonic
---
# 🎯 **When to Use Walrus Operator**

* When you want **less repetition**
* When you want **cleaner loops or conditions**
* When calculating a value only once is more efficient
---
# 🎯 **When NOT to Use**
* When it reduces readability
* For very simple assignments (not inside expressions)
# ⭐ **One-line Interview Definition**
> “The walrus operator (`:=`) allows assignment inside expressions. It is used to assign and use a value in the same line, 
especially in conditions and loops, making the code shorter and more efficient.'''

#AND: RETURNS TRUE IF BOTH STATEMENTS TRUE
#test if number is greater than zero and less than 10
x = 5

#OR : returns true if one of the statement is true

# is: returns true if both variables are the same object,
# is not: returns true if both variables are not the same object
#here is , is not  doesn't check values it checks memory location i.e objects in memory location

x =["apple","banana"] # it stores at memory A
y =["apple","banana"] # it stores at memory B
z = x                 # it stores at memory A as z=x

'''
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

List: is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
Tuple:is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
Set: is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
Dictionary:  is a collection which is ordered and changeable. No duplicate members.
*Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove and/or add items whenever you like.
**As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.
